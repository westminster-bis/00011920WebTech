            I was initially reluctant to get myself a personal trainer, but as
            my self-directed training plateaued I needed a proverbial kick up
            the arse. Lewis at the armoury delivered the kick I needed! Both
            online and in person, Lewis’ knowledge and ability to motivate
            really advanced my training and I achieved so much more than I would
            have on my own. If you’re looking for effective training, I haven’t
            found any place better.
          </p>

            After feeling tubby on the beach during my summer holiday, I dropped
            Lewis a message, went for a trial session and I’ve been working with
            Armoury Coaching since July 2018. I’m stronger now (can bench my
            bodyweight – an initial goal we set that felt impossible at the
            start), and I’ve lost over a stone and both look better and feel
            better in myself ​ I’ve gone from training 3 times a week to 5 times
            a week, as I’m seeing results i’m getting more motivated to train. I
            have a great programme set up and constant encouragement and
            support. Lewis is a great guy to work with and I’d highly recommend
            Armoury Coaching to improve your fitness and physique.”

            Training at The Armoury is awesome! The sessions are super fun,
            tough but in a good way & motivating. Never fails to put a smile on
            my face & I always leave feeling really good! Lewis is amazing, he
            has a huge amount of knowledge & experience in the industry & this
            is reflected in the training & support provided. You really are seen
            as an individual & everything is tailored to meet your goals, not
            just a one size fits all approach. ​ I’ve started the nutrition
            programme with Gen & it is far better than anything I’ve tried
            before. She really takes the time to know you & it’s much more than
            just telling you what to eat & when. Joining The Armoury was
            definitely the best decision I made!” ​
